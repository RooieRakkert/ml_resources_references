# Machine Learning and Data Science resources
This repository will hold a collection of valuable ML/DS resources and references.
Every reference and resource is given in no specific order.

> Currently, this repo is still a work-in-progress, the current setup is subject to change.

## Remember kids:

- Data Science gives you **insight**.
- Machine Learning brings you **predictions**.
- AI will perform **actions** based on aforementioned knowledge.

- The AI effect; *Everytime we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical. We say; 'Oh, its just a computation.'* (Rodney Brooks)
